NOTES

The OpenAPI does not take instrument names or symbols as identifiers. Instead, instruments are identified by a unique combination of UIC (Universal Instrument Code) and AssetType. Pulling this information for the specific instrument you are interested in is key to continue into other operations such as sending orders, building charts, creating reports, etc.
